## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/match-stik/Aerie/security/advisories/new) with:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment (what an attacker could do)

We'll acknowledge within 48 hours and aim to patch critical issues within 7 days.

## Security model

Aerie is self-hosted software that runs on your machine:

- **No cloud backend** — your data stays local (SQLite + filesystem)
- **No telemetry** — nothing phones home
- **Auth is optional** — password protection is available but not required for local-only use
- **Agent SDK queries** go through your Claude Code subscription — we never see them
- **MCP servers** are user-configured — we don't bundle or recommend specific ones

### What to watch for

- **Exposed ports** — if you expose Aerie to the internet, set a password and use HTTPS
- **CLAUDE.md contents** — this file is sent to the AI on every query. Don't put secrets in it
- **`.env` and `aerie.yaml`** — contain credentials. Both are gitignored by default
- **Discord/Telegram tokens** — treat these as secrets. Never commit them
