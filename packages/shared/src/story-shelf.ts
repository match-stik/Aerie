//
// A shelf of choose-your-own-path books the companions write and run for the
// owner of the house. They write through the loopback routes
// (/api/internal/story-shelf/...); the phone reads the shelf, opens a book and
// makes a move through /api/story-shelf. Both answer with the shapes below, so
// the phone and the backend code against the same contract, and the limits
// live here once so the phone never offers what the backend will refuse.
