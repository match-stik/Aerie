/**
 * Wakes Spotify on their phone without the owner leaving the app (Oct 23 2026). Spotify only takes a play for a device where it is
 * already running, so a tap from the house's Spotify app with Spotify closed
 * came back as nowhere to play; the page calls wake, then sends the owner's tap again
 * through the house. The waking itself is SpotifyWaker's, shared with the
 * silent push the house sends when one of us plays the owner a song.
 *
 * The kit needs this app's package name and signing fingerprint on the
 * Spotify app's developer page, the client id and a redirect registered to it
 * (the page hands both in, read off the house), and Spotify installed and
 * signed in. The first connect may show Spotify's own consent screen.
