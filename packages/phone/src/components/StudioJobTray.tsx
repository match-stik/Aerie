 * global. That was fine for a 36px status dot and completely wrong for a
 * paragraph. A failed job's words now render only while the Studio is the app
 * on screen; everywhere else the dot carries the state and nothing else does.

          back its whole invocation — flags, session id, and the ENTIRE prompt.
