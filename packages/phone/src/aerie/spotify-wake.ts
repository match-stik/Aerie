// Waking Spotify on their phone from inside the app (Oct 23 2026). A play tapped while Spotify is not running comes back as
// nowhere to play; in the installed app, SpotifyRemote (android
// SpotifyRemotePlugin.java, Spotify's App Remote kit) starts Spotify in the
// background and makes this phone the device that plays, and the press is
// sent once more (lib/spotify.ts pressAndLook). When the kit gives no answer
// (Oct 23 2026, their first try: it never called back and the press spun), the
// plugin sends Spotify a media play key instead, and the page waits for
// Spotify to show up among the owner devices before trying again. Nothing here can
// hold a press longer than WAKE_CEILING_MS. In a browser, or an app from
// before the kit, there is nothing to wake and the old sentence stands.
