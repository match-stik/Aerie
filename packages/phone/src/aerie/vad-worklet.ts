 * Source for the audio-thread ticker that wakes the speech detector.
 *
 * It is carried as a string and handed to the audio engine as a blob at
 * runtime, rather than shipped as its own file. A worklet module has to be
 * fetched from a same-origin URL, and a bundler is free to inline a small file
 * as a data URL — which some engines refuse to load. A blob is same-origin by
 * construction and there is nothing left to go wrong at delivery.
 *
 * The processor declares NO OUTPUTS on purpose. A node with outputs has to be
 * wired through to the speakers before it will run at all, and opening an
 * output path while the microphone is capturing lets echo cancellation scrub
 * the incoming audio to silence — which is exactly what it did. With no
 * outputs it is a sink: processed without being connected to anything
 * downstream, so none of the microphone's audio is ever routed to a speaker.
