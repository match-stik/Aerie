/**
 * Ask the gallery for a small copy of a picture.
 *
 * Studio's grid and its Recent rail were both loading full-size originals to
 * fill squares a couple of hundred pixels wide — thirty of them came to about
 * 72 MB, which is why they painted in slowly on a phone. The gallery route
 * makes a small version on request; this just adds the ask.
 *
 * A backend that predates thumbnails ignores the parameter and sends the
 * original, so this is safe to ship before a restart — worst case is exactly
 * how it behaved before. Videos and gifs are handled server-side and come
 * back whole.
 *
 * Only ever use this where something is being displayed SMALL. The full-size
 * viewer must keep asking for the real file — and so must anything that
 * SAVES, or the person would end up with the thumbnail on their phone instead
 * of the picture.
 *
 * Chat attachments (/api/files/) answer ?w= the same way. That is where every
 * image we send actually arrives, and its bubbles are a couple of hundred
 * pixels wide, so it was the biggest download in the house drawn the smallest.
