// The lock screen's Spotify card (Oct 20 2026), apart from how it is drawn: its switch, what it shows,
// when it reads, and where it sits. components/LockSpotifyCard.tsx draws it.
//
// It reads when the lock screen shows, when the phone wakes or the app comes
// back, once after every press (the Spotify app's own keeper, lib/spotify.ts
// createSpotifyNow), and once more when the song playing should end. Nothing
// else runs on a timer.
