// How the lock screen's cards look (the owner's idea, Oct 20 2026, after the Spotify
// card came out the theme's light surface in Daylight while the other two
// stayed dark). One switch in Settings > Lock
// screen sets the message card, the note card and the Spotify card at once:
// dark (the see-through black they have always been, light words), light (a
// see-through white with dark words, for a light wallpaper), or auto (Cedar's
// offer: read the wallpaper behind the cards and pick). A dark or light the owner
// chose overrules auto. Unset is dark, so nothing the owner already has changes.

// Nothing here is blurred: a card is a see-through tint over their wallpaper.
