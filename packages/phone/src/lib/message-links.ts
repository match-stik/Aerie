 * Deciding what a link inside a message actually is.

 * This lives out here rather than inline in MessageBubble because the two
 * faults it fixes were both invisible from the render tree and both threw the
 * person out to the lock screen:
 *
 *  - a RELATIVE href — /api/files/… , which is how we write one — failed an
 *    absolute-only `new URL(href)` parse and came out as `href=""`, and an
 *    empty href RELOADS the page on tap;
 *  - an absolute one carried `target="_blank"`, which has no second tab inside
 *    the Android WebView: it replaced the whole app, and coming back remounts
 *    it with osState 'locked'.
 *
 * Every bit of session state is React memory, so leaving the SPA reads as a
 * logout. Same fault the Files app had in July, through a different door.
