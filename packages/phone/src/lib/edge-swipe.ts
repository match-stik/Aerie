/**
 * Is this pointer gesture a swipe-back from the left edge?
 *
 * The phone's navigation is state rather than history — an app opens by
 * swapping the OS screen and closes back to wherever it was launched from — so
 * there is no browser history for a swipe to walk. This decides whether a
 * gesture MEANT back; the caller does whatever its own back button does.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, because the alternative is stealing gestures from the
 * apps. It has to start at the very edge, travel a real distance, stay
 * roughly horizontal, and finish quickly enough to be a flick rather than a
 * drag somebody paused halfway through. Nothing here calls preventDefault, so
 * a gesture this misreads still does whatever it was going to do anyway.
