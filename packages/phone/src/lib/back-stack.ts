/**
 * Who answers "back" first.
 *
 * The system back gesture and the back button both end up in one place, and
 * that place used to close the whole app — so an app with inner pages threw
 * away every step at once. Letters could be three deep in a letter and back
 * would put the person on the home screen.
 *
 * An app that has somewhere inner to go registers a handler while that is
 * true. Back asks the TOP handler and stops if it says it dealt with it;
 * otherwise the app closes, exactly as before.
 *
 * Only the top handler is asked, deliberately. Walking down the stack until
 * somebody accepts would mean a screen answering for a screen above it, and
 * the top one is by definition the thing the person is looking at.
 *
 * An app that registers nothing behaves precisely as it always has, which is
 * what makes this safe to wire one app at a time.
