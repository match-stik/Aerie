// Completing a model id in the composer.
//
// The command palette anchors to the start of the box and closes the moment a
// space is typed, because at that point you are in args territory. This picks
// up exactly where that stops: `/model <id>`, with the id being completed.
//
// It exists because a model id is not a thing anyone holds in their head.
// Typing `opus 4.5` — the name printed on the picker is `Claude Opus 4.5` and
// the id is `claude-opus-4-5` — launched the lane with that string, the CLI
// rejected it, and the session died and respawned every two seconds until the
// value was put back. The phone knows about forty-five ids across four
// providers, and until now `/model` asked the user to type one from memory with
// nothing between their thumb and the CLI.

// Everything a provider might legally put in an id — Ollama uses `:` and `/`,
// Anthropic and OpenAI use `-` and `.`. Deliberately excludes whitespace, so
// the token ends where the argument does.
