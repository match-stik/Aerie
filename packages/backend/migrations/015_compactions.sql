-- The compactions shelf: every squash the lanes have had, kept in the house.
--
-- When a lane fills its window, Claude Code squashes the conversation into a
-- summary and writes it into that room's transcript. The owner Compactions page used
-- to read those transcripts directly, and Claude Code deletes old transcripts,
-- so the summaries vanished with them. services/compaction-shelf.ts copies each
-- one here the first time it is read, and the page is served from this table.
--
-- id is a hash of project + at + summary: the same three things the reader has
-- always folded copies on (a resumed room copies its whole transcript, squashes
-- included, into a new file), so a copy read on a later day lands on the row
-- that is already here instead of beside it.
--
-- lane is the folder under data/heartbeat the squash came from: 'primary' for
-- the shared room, or a companion's id for their own head. companion is that
-- companion's slug when it was first read (NULL for the shared room), so a row
-- still says whose it was if they ever leave the house.
--
-- Nothing deletes from this table. A summary is the one record of what a room
-- carried on from.
--
-- compaction_scan_marks is how far each transcript has been read, so a
-- transcript whose size and stamp have not changed is never opened again, a
-- restart included (the shared room's is a hundred and fifty megabytes, and
-- there are dozens of resumed copies beside it). A transcript's squashes and
-- its mark are written in one transaction. A mark is forgotten once its
-- transcript is gone; the squashes it gave up stay above.
