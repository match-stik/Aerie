-- The Story Shelf — choose-your-own-path books the companions write and run.
--
-- They write through the loopback routes; the owner of the house reads on the
-- phone and makes the moves there. A book holds the base story they wrote for
-- it (the bible) and its pages in order: a scene is a companion's, a move is
-- the owner's, and each scene answers the move before it.
--
-- NO CHECK CONSTRAINTS ON status OR kind, ON PURPOSE: SQLite cannot alter a
-- constraint in place, so a CHECK list that outlives the code it was written
-- for means rebuilding the table.
-- services/db/story-shelf.ts is the only writer and it validates both.
--
-- image_url / cover_url hold the relative Studio gallery URL
-- (/api/studio/gallery/<file>), exactly as Studio itself hands them out.
-- state_json and choices_json are written only by that module, already checked.
