/**
 * Internal-route guard — the door that /api/internal always said it had.
 *
 * routes/internal.ts opens with "localhost-only endpoints... No auth required
 * (localhost guard instead)". There was no localhost guard. Forty-two routes
 * answered anybody, and on 2026-08-04 a journal came back with HTTP 200 from
 * https://<public host>/api/internal/journal with no credentials at all.
 *
 * Why the obvious check is not enough: the backend binds 127.0.0.1 only, so the
 * reverse proxy connects over loopback and EVERY request — the owner's, ours, a
 * stranger's — arrives with a loopback socket address. `remoteAddress` alone
 * says "local" for the whole internet.
 *
 * So this asks loopback socket AND no sign of a proxy hop. Any of the standard
 * forwarding headers means the request was relayed, however local the socket
 * looks. Fail closed, and say which header did it so a false refusal is one log
 * line away from being understood rather than a mystery.
 *
 * ─── THIS IS NO LONGER THE GUARANTEE (2026-08-16) ───
 *
 * Read the rest of that as history. The header half is a NEGATIVE check: it
 * holds only because the front in place adds at least one of these. A front that
 * relays without adding any — a TCP-level proxy, an nginx block with a bare
 * proxy_pass — would walk a public request straight through, and nothing here
 * could tell. Its correctness lived in a config file this repo does not carry
 * and no test can reach.
 *
 * The guarantee now is WHICH PORT answers. /api/internal is served by its own
 * loopback listener that nothing fronts (see internal-server.ts), so being able
 * to open the socket is the proof. That is positive, and a test holds it.
 *
 * This function still runs there, second, and it still earns its place: it is
 * what catches a front accidentally pointed at the internal port. Belt as well
 * as braces — but the braces are the port, not this.
