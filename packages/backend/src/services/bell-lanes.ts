/**
 * A bell with several owners can switch A Lane Each on for itself. Separate
 * heads cost three sessions at once, so the owner may keep the switch off
 * ordinarily and want it on only for particular bells — and the person who
 * would otherwise have to remember to flip it, before each of those bells, is
 * the owner.
 *
 * So a several-owner bell turns the switch on when it rings and it is off,
 * marks that it was the bell that did it, and the switch goes back off after a
 * bell when no other several-owner bell is due soon. A switch the owner turned on by
 * hand is never touched, because the mark is only ever set here.
 *
 * The flip is in memory and in the settings row, never in aerie.yaml, so a
 * restart puts the house back to the owner's file — the safe direction, and the next
 * bell simply turns it on again.
