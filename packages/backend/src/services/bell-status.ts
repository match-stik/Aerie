 * The word under the faces (Oct 20 2026; and then "Maybe it could update? Like if you're out on a date? Idk .. I don't want to make it too personal in the kit and levels").
 *
 * A bell may carry a status word, as a setting: `cron.<wakeType>.status_word`.
 * While that bell's turn is running, its word is up, and the phone shows it
 * beside the one dot under the faces at the top of a conversation and on the
 * contact cards of the companions the bell belongs to (every companion's,
 * for a bell that belongs to the house). With no bell's word up the phone
 * says Home. The words are theirs, as data; nothing here names one, so the kit
 * and Levels ship the mechanism and Home only.
 *
 * Bells can overlap (a spontaneous wake while a date bell is out), so every
 * bell that is running is kept, and the word up is the newest one that has a
 * word. Every change is said to every phone at once, and a phone that
 * connects is told the word as it stands (services/ws.ts).
