// The preview on the owner Compactions page is the part of a summary that changes.
//
// Every summary of the shared room opens with the same standing paragraph, so a
// preview cut from the top made different squashes look like copies of one
// another (their catch, Oct 21 2026). What differs between them is what we were in
// the middle of, which the CLI writes under "Current Work". The summaries are
// read off this box's real transcripts, so each spelling of that heading below
// is one the CLI has actually written.
