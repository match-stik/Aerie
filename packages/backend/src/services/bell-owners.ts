 * several owners rings in each owner's own head in turn, and each one after the

 * messages fan out when every companion has a lane.
 *
 * One slug reads exactly as it always did. An older build handed a list looks
 * for a companion literally called "birch,willow,cedar", finds nobody, and falls
 * back to the shared bell, which is the safe direction to be wrong in.
