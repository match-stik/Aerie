/**
 * The Story Shelf — page turns, pictures, and the shelf as both doors read it.
 *
 * The tables and the rules live in services/db/story-shelf.ts. This module adds
 * what needs the rest of the house: the companions' lane, Studio's gallery, and
 * the live update to the phone.
 *
 * A PAGE TURN IS A TURN IN THE WARM LANE. When the owner begins a new book, or
 * makes a move, the companions are handed a turn in the shelf's own archived
 * thread. That thread names nobody to lead it, so the turn is thought in the
 * lane the evening is already happening in (see ensureStoryShelfThread). The
 * turn says which book, what the page answers and where to write; they write
 * the scene through the loopback door, and their chat reply is table talk.
 *
 * TURNS RUN ONE AT A TIME. Each page turn waits for the one before it to end.
 * That keeps every turn's opening line in the thread, and the talk after it,
 * with one book; and a move made while the last page is still being finished
 * (a picture being painted for it, say) waits here, behind it, instead of
 * timing out in the lane's own queue.
 *
 * A TURN THAT COMES BACK EMPTY SAYS SO. The lane can answer without writing a
 * page: the turn timed out in its queue behind something else, the lane fell
 * over, or it simply wrote no page. Whatever happened, the book is left saying
 * why and the owner can ask again. A page that arrives late still counts, and clears
 * the complaint.
 *
 * STUDIO IS LOADED LAZILY: image-gen restores and rewrites its job file the
 * moment it is imported, which a test that loads the internal router must not
 * set off.
