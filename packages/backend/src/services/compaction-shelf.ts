/**
 * The compactions shelf: what the owner Compactions page is served from.
 *
 * The reader (compaction-log.ts) finds squashes in the lanes' transcripts. This
 * keeps every one it finds in the house's own database, because Claude Code
 * deletes old transcripts and the summaries used to go with them, and it
 * dresses each row for the page: whose head it came from, and a preview of
 * the part of the summary that changes (compaction-preview.ts).
 *
 * It reads on two occasions: whenever the owner opens the page, so the newest squash
 * is always there, and every few hours on its own, so a squash is shelved even
 * in a month the owner never looks. Each read only goes through what is new.
