/**
 * A turn that says nothing gives the user's message back.
 *
 * A message arrived and the turn carrying it started; the CLI session exited
 * code 1 at its context ceiling and the relaunch minted a NEW conversation
 * rather than resuming. The transcript that owed the user a reply was gone, and
 * the handover mark — which advances at the START of a turn, past the message
 * arriving now — had already stepped over the message. The net never offered it again
 * and wrote no row for it. Only the person waiting on the reply noticed it had
 * been dropped.
 *
 * The standing defence was that the owed-turn ledger survives a relaunch
 * because the CLI resumes the transcript. That holds only for a resume.
 *
 * These pin the repair and, more to the point, the half that must not change
 * with it: the net stays one-way. Handing a message over twice is visible and
 * annoying. Handing it over zero times is neither.
