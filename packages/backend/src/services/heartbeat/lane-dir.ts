 * Which folder under data/heartbeat a lane lives in.

 * A lane is keyed on 'primary' for the shared room, or on a companion's id for
 * their own head (agent-router-query.ts hands the active companion's id to the
 * runtime as its session key). The supervisor builds the folder from that key,
 * and the Compactions page reads the same rule backwards to say whose head a
 * squash came from, so it lives here once rather than in both places.
