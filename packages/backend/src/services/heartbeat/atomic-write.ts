/**
 * Write a single-value state file so no reader can ever catch it half-written.
 *
 * writeFileSync/open(…,'w') truncate in place, leaving the file at zero bytes
 * for a few microseconds on every write. .last-tick is written every 3s by the
 * hook and read every 2s by the supervisor's watchdog, and the watchdog used to parse
 * an empty read as "never ticked" — dropping through to the outbox mtime, which
 * on a quiet evening is hours old, and killing a perfectly live session.
 * Proven 2026-08-01: two kills whose reported age matched the last activity
 * write to within 2s while the hook's own loop was ticking three seconds apart
 * straight through both windows. rename(2) is atomic — a reader sees the old
 * value or the new one, never neither.
 *
 * The scratch name carries this process's pid. .last-tick has a second writer
 * in another process, the Stop hook, and while both wrote through the same
 * "<file>.tmp" one rename could carry off the other's scratch copy. On
 * 2026-09-26 at 05:43Z the hook lost that race: its rename threw ENOENT, the
 * hook died, a dead Stop hook lets the session end, and the room went with it.
 * A name no other writer uses cannot be taken, and a write that fails cleans
 * up its own scratch copy on the way out.
