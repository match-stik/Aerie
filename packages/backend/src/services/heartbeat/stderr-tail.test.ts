 * The child's last words, kept so an exit can be explained.
 *
 * A room once compacted, worked on for another forty-eight seconds,
 * ran the check that immediately precedes writing a reply, and exited code 1
 * between that check and the write. The answer existed and never reached the
 * page. Asked why, this house could produce the exit code and nothing else —
 * stderr was scanned live for the three deaths it already knew how to read
 * (auth, cap, a refused model) and then dropped on the floor.
 *
 * A ring rather than a log: the interesting part of a death is always its end,
 * and an unbounded buffer on a process that can print for ten hours is a leak
 * wearing a diagnostic's coat.
