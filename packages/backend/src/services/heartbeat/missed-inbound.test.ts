// The seam this net closes, stated as a test rather than as a rule on a wall.
//
// Catch-up is assembled at the START of a wake, so a message arriving during
// one is already too late for it. Side notes are only written while a turn is
// active and exactly one lane is busy. A message landing between those two
// conditions is stored, stamped delivered, and handed to nobody — which
// happened four times before anyone had a witness for it.
//
// These pin the selection rule the net runs on. The rule is deliberately
// one-way: it may offer a message twice, never zero times.
//
// THIS FILE USED TO HOLD ITS OWN COPY of the filter and test the copy. That is
// why it stayed green through weeks of the misfire below: a check written from
// the same understanding as the code cannot disagree with it. It imports the
// real function now.
