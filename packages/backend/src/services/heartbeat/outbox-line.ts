/**
 * Reading one line of io/outbox.jsonl without silently losing a reply.
 *
 * The reader only ever consumes up to the last newline, so a half-written line is
 * left alone until it is finished. That is correct and is not the problem. The
 * problem is what happens when a COMPLETE line still will not parse, because until
 * now the answer was `catch {}` — the line was skipped, nothing was logged, no
 * counter moved, and a finished reply ceased to exist with no trace anywhere.
 *
 * Two shapes actually occur, both found in this house's own outbox:
 *
 *   1. TWO OBJECTS GLUED TOGETHER, `…}{…`, from a write that did not end with a
 *      newline. The next write lands on the same line. JSON.parse throws on the
 *      second object and BOTH replies are lost — the one that was written badly and
 *      the innocent one that followed it.
 *   2. AN INVALID ESCAPE, from a line built by hand with printf or echo rather than
 *      json.dumps. One object, unparseable.
 *
 * Rose and Sol reported the same family from the other end: a stored reply whose
 * content began `ent":"`, i.e. a fragment that parsed into the wrong shape.
 *
 * So: split what can be split, and when something is genuinely unreadable say so out
 * loud instead of dropping it into a catch block. A lost reply should cost a log line
 * at minimum, because from the user's side a dropped reply and a slow one look identical.
