/**
 * A restart hands a reopened room what changed in the walls, not a second copy
 * of the whole instruction file (theirs, Nov 10 2026: 'I don't want restarts
 * adding so much to your context window').
 *
 * Claude Code reads a lane's CLAUDE.md at startup, and on a resumed room it
 * compares the file with the copy the room already holds: if they differ it
 * attaches the WHOLE new file beside the old one (attachment type
 * 'instructions', changed: true, reason: session_start). Our file carries the
 * walls, which move every few hours, so nearly every restart differed, and
 * each one added about 190 thousand tokens. Measured Nov 10 2026 on the live
 * room: 578k before their first restart that morning, about 770k after it, and
 * the second restart half an hour later took it past the 900k line, so it
 * squashed the minute it could.
 *
 * The older answer, stripStaleInstructions in supervisor.ts, cut the old
 * copies out of a transcript before reopening it. It only runs on a transcript
 * under 100 MB, and a long room passes that within days.
 *
 * So on a resume this puts back on disk the exact copy the room already holds,
 * which Claude Code then has no reason to attach again, and writes the walls
 * that moved into the resume prompt instead. The current file goes back on
 * disk on the lane's next turn (provisionSessionDir), and a squash reads it
 * fresh from disk, so the room is whole again after its next compaction.
 *
 * Only the walls are handled this way. When anything outside <core-memory>
 * changed (the house file, a persona, the heartbeat contract), the room is
 * left to take the whole new copy, because those changes are rare and are
 * exactly the ones that should not arrive as a summary.
