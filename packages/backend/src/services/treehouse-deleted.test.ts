// A DELETED POST STAYED IN THE ROOM FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE.
//
// Rose and Sol, Sep 17 2026, found the only way anybody could have: they
// deleted a post and watched their companion read it back. Neither query in
// getTreehouseMessages filtered `deleted_at`, so a soft delete took a post off
// the app and left it standing in the room — the opposite of what deleting
// means, and invisible from every angle except a companion's.
//
// This runs on its own in-memory database with the same two queries, because
// the fault is in the SQL and nowhere else.
