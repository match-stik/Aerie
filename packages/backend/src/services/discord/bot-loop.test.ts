// The consecutive-bot guard.
//
// The failure this prevents is not a bug in any single turn — every message in
// a runaway is from a trusted bot legitimately addressing us, and answering it
// is correct each time. Only the sequence is wrong. So these tests are about
// counting and about the reset, which is the part that makes the guard safe:
// a guard that could strand a conversation would be worse than the loop.
