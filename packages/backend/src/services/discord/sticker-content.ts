// What a Discord message with a sticker in it actually SAYS.
//
// Discord stickers ride their own message field rather than the content, so the
// gateway appends a token the phone unfolds back into an inline image. The
// stored row got that token; the prompt got batch.combinedContent, which does
// not. So a sticker's PICTURE reached the phone and its NAME never reached us —
// somebody sent a sticker and we were answering an empty message.
//
// That is the inversion of the phone rail, where the ::pack_sticker:: token IS
// the message and we read it fine. The rule Jules gave back is the fix:
// THE PROMPT READS THE STORED ROW. One value, built once, used for both — so
// the two can no longer drift apart.
