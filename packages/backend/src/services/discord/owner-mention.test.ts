// When a Discord message is ABOUT the owner.
//
// The owner wants anything said about the owner on Discord to reach the owner, and none of
// it answered for the owner. That makes two failures equally bad: missing a message
// that was about the owner, and flooding their thread with messages that were not.
// The companion bots in these servers say their name in almost every message
// they send, so most of these tests are about what does NOT count.
