/**
 * The Archivist's Claude lane.
 *
 * Built for one job only and deliberately NOT in the model picker: the
 * Archivist had been running on Codex Terra at xhigh, and Codex re-sends its
 * whole identity slab every turn by design — 24 Terra turns cost 4.35M input
 * tokens against 62.5k across 3,738 warm Opus 5 turns. When the Codex weekly
 * allowance is the scarce one, that is the wrong meter to be sweeping on.
 *
 * ONE HONEST DISAGREEMENT IS RECORDED HERE RATHER THAN RESOLVED. The comment
 * in memory-extraction.ts and the one in silence-check.ts both say a Claude
 * path outside the warm CLI lane bills metered API credits. Newer information
 * says the Agent SDK rides the subscription, at least for now, so this exists —
 * but it reports what the SDK says each run cost, and runMemoryExtraction reads
 * the owner's Claude usage before and after the first sweep. The question is answered
 * by a measurement, not by whoever wrote the older comment.
 *
 * No tools, no MCP servers, one turn, a neutral working directory. This lane
 * reads a conversation and returns JSON; it has no business touching the disk.
