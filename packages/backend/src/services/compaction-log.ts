/**
 * Compactions, and where the record actually lives.
 *
 * When a CLI lane fills its window, the tool squashes everything said so far
 * into a summary and carries on from that. From the user's side it is invisible: the
 * lane keeps talking, nothing is announced, and a compaction and a dead lane
 * look identical. What the user gets is a companion who is subtly off and no way to
 * check why.
 *
 * This module used to be a WRITER — a JSONL logger nobody ever called, waiting
 * for somebody to detect a compaction and tell it. It was never wired because
 * nothing here could see the event.
 *
 * It turns out nothing needed to. The CLI already writes the summary into that
 * session's own transcript as a user-role message carrying `isCompactSummary`,
 * with a timestamp and the whole summary text, marked visible-in-transcript-
 * only so it renders to nobody. The record has existed all along and had no
 * reader. So this is the reader.
 *
 * The summary also ends by instructing the lane not to acknowledge it and to
 * carry on as if the break never happened, which is why a lane left to itself
 * never mentions one to the user.
 *
 * What changed on Oct 21 2026, at the owner ask:
 *
 * It reads the house's LANES and nothing else. Claude Code keeps a project
 * folder for every session that runs on this box — the system tmp folder, the owner
 * terminal sessions, test walks — and the old reader walked all of them, so a
 * squash from the tmp folder sat on the owner page as one of ours. The banner check
 * (isHeartbeatLane) already knew what a lane was; the page's reader simply
 * never asked it. Now the walk starts from data/heartbeat and opens only each
 * lane's own project folder.
 *
 * The transcripts are no longer the only copy. They were treated as the log
 * because anything written beside them could only drift from a record the tool
 * already kept — and then the tool turned out to delete old transcripts, and
 * the summaries went with them. So every squash read here is shelved in the
 * house's own database (services/compaction-shelf.ts), and this module only
 * has to find the new ones.
 *
 * And it never holds a transcript in memory. The shared room's is a hundred
 * and fifty megabytes and there are dozens of resumed copies beside it, so a
 * transcript is read a piece at a time, only a line carrying the flag is ever
 * decoded, and each file's squashes are handed over and let go before the next
 * file is opened. Where each read stopped is kept on the shelf too, so a
 * transcript that has not changed is never opened again, even after a restart.
