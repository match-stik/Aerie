// somebody's hand and nothing anywhere throws — so the manifest and the files
// are checked against each other here rather than trusted.
//
// These tests read the real deck. They skip rather than fail if it has not been
// cut, because the art is gitignored and a fresh clone has no data/cards.
//
// The skip has to be a real skip. Returning early reports as a PASS, so on a
// clone this file went green while asserting nothing at all — five tests'
// worth of coverage that looked present and was not.
