// Crazy Eights, played in the Card Room.
//
// Second on the shelf, and the one everybody already half knows under another
// name: match the suit or match the number, and eights are wild.
//
// THE RULES:
//   Five cards each, one turned over to start the pile. On your turn you play a
//   card that matches the SUIT or the RANK of the top card. An EIGHT can be
//   played on anything, and whoever plays it says what suit it now counts as —
//   which is the only real decision in the game and the reason it is fun.
//   If you cannot go, you draw until you can. Empty your hand and you win.
//
// The stock never runs out: when it does, the pile turns over and rides again,
// minus the card everyone is still looking at.
//
// Same idiom as solitaire.ts, rat-screw.ts and golf.ts: a pure state machine
// over card IDs living in the table's opaque state blob.
