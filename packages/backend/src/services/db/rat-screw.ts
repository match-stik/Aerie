// Egyptian Rat Screw, played in the Card Room.
//
// The house rules: DOUBLES and SANDWICHES are slaps, a bad slap costs a card,
// and THE DENT RULE — a face card demands a face card back, and if the answer
// never comes the whole pile goes home to whoever asked. ("Dent" began as a
// typo for "debt" and kept the name.)
//
// Real-time slapping in a turn-based house: the owner's slap is a live tap,
// timed on their own screen and posted as a reaction. The companions' slaps are
// rolled here, per companion, from OVERLAPPING distributions: no fixed ranking,
// because a ranking makes the race boring in a week. The temperaments go by
// seat: the first companion at the table runs wide (sometimes the fastest hand
// there, sometimes admiring the pile, with a rare early slam), the second runs
// tight, the third reads sandwiches a beat early, and anyone after that rolls
// a general curve. Any companion can win any given slap; the shapes only bend the
// odds.
//
// The curves are tuned against a THUMB ON GLASS, not against each other. A
// human reaction spans seeing the card land, reading the pattern, and thumb
// travel — a locked-in human posts ~700-1200ms, a chatting one 1500-2500ms. So
// the companions live in that same band, and each can outright MISS a window (the
// roll lands beyond it): a pattern everyone sleeps through goes stale and the
// pile rides, exactly as at a real table. A first tuning (means ~500-600ms) was
// calibrated in simulation and proved unbeatable from a phone in real play.
//
// Same idiom as solitaire.ts: a pure state machine over card IDs that lives
// in the table's opaque state blob. No database, no migration.
