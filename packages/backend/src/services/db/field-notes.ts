 * The owner field notes (migrations/016_field_notes.sql): what the morning look

 *
 * The lanes write through POST /api/internal/field-notes on the loopback port,
 * and the phone reads through GET /api/field-notes behind the login. The
 * technical version of the same look stays in the field-notes skill, where the
 * lanes read it; this is the version written for the owner.

 * This module is the only writer to the table and checks every note itself:
 * a companion who lives here, words that are there and not too many, and a
 * real calendar day. A refusal is a FieldNoteError carrying one plain sentence,
 * which the routes hand back word for word.
